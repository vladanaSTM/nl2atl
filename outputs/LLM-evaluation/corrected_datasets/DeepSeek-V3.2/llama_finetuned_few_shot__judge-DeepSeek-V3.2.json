However, 'max_force' is a different predicate from 'force_over_limit' and changes the meaning: exceeding a limit is not the same as being at maximum force. Also, the inner G in the gold ensures the property holds forever after the condition, but the prediction's 'G!max_force' could be interpreted as a single temporal operator applied to a negated atom, which is not equivalent to the nested G in the gold. The coalition is correct, but the property semantics differ.",
